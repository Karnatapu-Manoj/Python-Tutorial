what is PYTHON:
---------------
	Python is a Multiparadigm Programmming Language invented by GUIDO VAN ROSSUM in 1991, which is derived from Monty Python's Flying Circus.

	Python is easy to learn, powerful programming language, the application development process is much faster & easier. 
	(Simple, Faster & Easier)

	it is a General Purpose (/) Dynamic (/) High Level (/) Interpreted (/) Multi-Paradigm

	PYTHON Moto is: Write less, Create more, Run Everywhere...!

Features of PYTHON:
====================

 Easy to learn & use
 Expressive Language
 Cross-Platform Language
 Free & Open Source(FLOSS)
 Object-Oriented Language
 Large Standard Library Support
 Extensible
 GUI Programming Support
 Integrated

Limitations of PYTHON:
======================


1. Application Portability
2. Weak in Mobile Computing


Technologies & it's Purpose:
============================

	In Software Industry every Technology has its own Purpose

C-Language: Embedded Systems & IOS App development.

C++ : Graphics & Gamming Implementation.

JAVE Language : Web & Gamming Development

.Net : Console & windows Programming

PYTHON : Complex data processing & general purpose language.
		(Suitable to develop any kind of Software & Products)

PHP : Web programming

Java Script : Client side Validation....!

Why PYTHON is General Purpose Language:
=======================================

	Python is used to develop the following software Applications.

	1.WebApps==> Django, Pyramid, Flask, CherryPy...!
	2.Desktop GUI Apps===> TKinter, WxWidgets, Kivy, PyQt.
	3.Software Development===> Build Control & Testing
	4.Scientific & Numeric===> SciPy, Pandas, Numpy..!
	5.Business Apps===> Tryton, Oodo
	6.Console Based Apps===> IPython
	7.Audio/Video Apps===>TimPlayer,Cplay
	8.3D CAD Apps===> Fandango

After Succesfully Installation in Windows Then

PYTHON Run Modes:
=================

	There are two Run modes available in Python

	1. Interactive Run Mode. (Basic Mode)
	2. Scripting Run Mode. (Advanced Mode)

	Interactive Run Mode:
	``````````````````````
	
		it is giving chance to run commands line by line Python Offers a Comfortable CLI with the python Shell
		(>>>.Triple Chevron) which is also known as the "PYTHON Interactive Shell".
		
		IDLE ----> Integrated Development Learning Environment
		
		Python IDLE shell Colors:
		``````````````````````````
				Keywords-----------Orange, Purple
				Stdin--------------Black
				Stdout-------------Blue
				Strings------------Green
				Comments/Errors----RED
		
		Shell Knowledge:
		````````````````
	
			Collection of Commands is called Shell

		DOS Shell(.bat)----------------------Collection of DOS Commands
		Windows Shell(.wsh)------------------Collection of Windows Commands
		Unix Shell #(.sh)Standard Shell $--------Collection of Unix Commands



		Indentation:
		````````````
			it is a Space or Tab b/w the triple Chevron & the string/statement. Never spaces,Tabs,Never Spaces+Tabs
			Indentation is Mandatory.


		String:
		```````

		* Single Quote====> Char(s)
		* Double Quote====> String or group of Characters
		* Triple Single Quote====> String Documentation (or) Multiline doc
		* Triple Double Quote====> Character Documentation (or) MultiCharacter Doc

		Python Help() Function:
		```````````````````````

		it displays the Documentation string.It is used to see the Help related to modules, keywords, attributes...etc.
		>>>help(print)   >>>help(input)   >>>help()  >>>help(quit)

		Python Alternative Flavours:
		````````````````````````````

			CPython   (Python for C)
			Jython    (Python for JAVA)
			IronPyton (Python for .Net)
			PyPy      (Python for Speed)
			MicroPython(for Micro Processors)
			PyDoop, PySpark (for Big Data Frameworks)
			Brython   (Replace JavaScript with Python)
			RubyPython(Python + Ruby)
			WinPython (Python Distribution for Windows)
			PyObjC    (Python for Object C)
			Anaconda Python (Handling Huge Volume of data processing)


		
	Script Run Mode:
	````````````````
		You can store code in a file & use the interpreter to execute the contents of the file, which is called Script.
	Python Scripts have names that end with " .py " Extension.

	Types of Extensions:
	````````````````````
		.py  ----> Python File (Regular script)
		.py3 ----> Python 3 Script (rarely used)
		.pyc ----> This is the Compiled byte code / Compiled Script (byte code)
		.pyd ----> this is basically a windows DLL File
		.pyo ----> This is Optimized pyc file
		.pyw ----> Python Script for Windows
		.pyz ----> Python Script Archived (Compressed or Zip Formated)


 
	IDE ----> Integrated Development Environment
	
			it is a Software application, that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programming for software development.

	Popular IDE's for PYTHON as per 2019-IEEE standards:
	````````````````````````````````````````````````````

		JetBrains PyCharm
		Anaconda Supported IDE's
		Spyder
		Jupiter
		VS Code
		Atom
		Rodeo
		Sublime Text


		PyDev:
		```````
			PyDev is a Python IDE for Eclipse, which may be used in Python, Jython and IronPython development.
